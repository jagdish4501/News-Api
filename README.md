# Documentation (News API )


follow the https://newsapi.org/docs Documentation

and replace the https://newsapi.org  with https://new-api-fnsb.onrender.com/


and /v2 with /api


for example :

GET https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=bitcoin&apiKey=YourAPIKEY

and 

GET https://new-api-fnsb.onrender.com/api/everything?q=bitcoin

give same result  (if you got a message to many request then  try again you surely get result"

note in original api you need to use your own api key but in my API you donot need any api key 

## you can make unlimited number of API hit with my API 😁😁
